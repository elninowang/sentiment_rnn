    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN 使用RNN来进行情绪分析\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "在这本笔记本中，您将实施执行情绪分析的循环神经网络。 使用RNN而不是feedfoward网络更准确，因为我们可以包括有关*sequence*的信息。 在这里，我们将使用电影评论的数据集，并附有标签。\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",

    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "在这里，我们将传入一个嵌入层。 我们需要一个嵌入层，因为我们有数万个单词，所以我们需要比单热编码向量更有效地表示输入数据。 你应该从word2vec课程中看到过。 实际上你可以用word2vec来训练一个嵌入，并在这里使用它。 但是，只要拥有一个嵌入层，让网络学习嵌入表就可以了。\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "从嵌入层，新的表示将被传递给LSTM单元。 这些将添加到网络的重复连接，因此我们可以包括关于数据中单词序列的信息。 最后，LSTM单元将在这里进入S形输出层。 我们正在使用sigmoid，因为我们试图预测这个文本是否有积极或消极的情绪。 输出层只是一个单一的单元，然后具有S形激活功能。\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label.\n",
    "\n",
    "我们不关心Sigmoid输出，除了最后一个，我们可以忽略其余的。 我们将从最后一步的输出和培训标签计算成本。"
